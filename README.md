# Data Extraction and NLP---Scrapping and Text_Analysis

## Overview

This project involves scraping text data from a website and performing comprehensive natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the content. The analysis includes cleaning the text by removing stopwords, calculating sentiment scores (positive, negative, and polarity), and evaluating various text metrics such as average sentence length, fog index, complex word count, and average syllable count per word. The processed results are then exported to a CSV file for detailed examination.

## Features                    

Web Scraping: Extracts text data from a specified website using web scraping techniques.                             
Text Preprocessing: Cleans the data by removing common stopwords, allowing focus on meaningful content.                            
Sentiment Analysis: Calculates sentiment metrics, including positive, negative, and overall polarity scores to gauge the sentiment conveyed in the text.                           
Text Metrics: Assesses the text by measuring average sentence length, fog index (a readability score), complex word count, and average syllable count per word.                   
Output: Saves the analysis results in a CSV file for easy review and further analysis.                                     

## Libraries Used

requests: For sending HTTP requests to retrieve web content.                                     
BeautifulSoup: For parsing HTML and extracting data from web pages.                              
pandas: For data manipulation and exporting results to a CSV file.                                   
os: For interacting with the operating system, such as file paths.
nltk: For natural language processing tasks, including tokenization and stopwords removal.                                    
re: For regular expression operations to clean and preprocess text.                                     

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine.                                            
Install the required Python packages by referring to the requirements.txt file. Make sure Python is installed on your system.

##Usage

Configure the scraping URL in the provided configuration file.                             
Run the main script to initiate the scraping and text analysis processes.                                                       
The processed results will be saved in an output.csv file in the project directory.                                           

## Analysis Details                                              
Stopwords Removal: The nltk library is used to remove common stopwords, which helps focus on the essential parts of the text.                                

## Sentiment Scores:
Positive Score: Measures the extent of positive sentiment in the text.                                  
Negative Score: Measures the extent of negative sentiment.                                                             
Polarity Score: Provides an overall sentiment polarity of the text.                                          

## Text Metrics:                                  
Average Sentence Length: Calculated as the average number of words per sentence.                                         
Fog Index: A readability metric indicating the complexity of the text.                                           
Complex Word Count: Counts words with three or more syllables.                                   
Average Syllable Count: Determines the average number of syllables per word.                                           

## Example                                   
The output.csv file will contain columns with text segments, sentiment scores, average sentence length, fog index, complex word count, and average syllable count. These metrics provide insights into the content's readability and sentiment.
